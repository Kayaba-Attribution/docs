# Receive Forta Alerts

Forta comprises a decentralized network of independent node operators that scan all transactions and block-by-block state changes for threats and anomalies. When an issue is detected, scan nodes send alerts to subscribers, which enables them to take action.

A **Detection Bot** analyzes all transactions and blocks from a network, executes custom logic, then emits information to Forta in the form of **Alerts**.

The network features both generic bots which monitor the broad ecosystem, as well as customized bots built for specific protocols. Please find below the best option for your case:
