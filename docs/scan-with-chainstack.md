# Chainstack Introduces Forta Support 

Chainstack continues to break new ground, as the Forta protocol becomes available within the list of supported networks on the platform. With this new addition, you will soon be able to launch a Forta scan node as part of the available options under all subscription plans. 

Thanks to Chainstack’s reliable infrastructure, deploying a Forta scan node to enhance security and threat detection while building and scaling decentralized applications is that much more accessible. So, forget about all the woes that come with managing nodes yourself and start putting more time towards generating value with your project.

## What Is Forta?

Launched in late 2021, [Forta](https://forta.org/) is a real-time detection network whose purpose is to enhance security and operational monitoring of blockchain activity. In its goal to offer decentralized monitoring as a network, Forta serves to identify threats and anomalies in DeFi, NFT, governance, bridges, and other Web3 applications as they happen live. 

Under the hood of Forta, lies a decentralized network of independent node operators that perform scans on all transactions, as well as state changes in each block for anomalous transactions and threats. Once an anomaly is detected, node operators parse alerts to relevant subscribers about the potential risks, in turn allowing them to take appropriate action.

At present, Forta supports a wide range of networks, including Ethereum, Avalanche, Polygon, BNB Chain, Fantom, and Arbitrum, among those also available on the Chainstack platform. This extensive interoperability allows Web3 developers to take advantage of its vast security and monitoring capabilities, regardless of the protocol in question. 

## Building On Forta

To start using Forta, you first need to subscribe to its data feeds, which can be accomplished via the [Forta App](https://app.forta.network/), [OpenZeppelin Defender](https://openzeppelin.com/defender/), or via the [public Forta API](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkxS7d2i5ms) directly. When it comes to running your own detection bots atop the Forta network, you can do so via the SDK, which also offers various [templates](https://github.com/arbitraryexecution/forta-bot-templates) and [examples](https://github.com/forta-network/forta-bot-examples), so you don’t have to start from scratch. You can also hire a development team to create a bot for your project via the [Bot Development Marketplace](https://www.notion.so/forta/Agent-Development-Marketplace-f8584bee618746319e9615f7a045df37).

The bots themselves are composed of a set of code scripts stored in a Docker container and serve the purpose of processing blockchain data to identify anomalies from preset conditions. These can be, for example, flash loan attacks, or an account balance falling below a particular threshold. Once a bot detects an anomaly, it sends out alerts to the users subscribed to it. The execution of each bot’s code is performed by scan nodes.

Scan nodes are something that is inherent to the Forta network. As mentioned previously, they execute the code of detection bots for each new transaction and block that is committed on a particular chain. The goal of a scan node is to manage the bots’ activities like in the case of instantiating, running, and restarting them, should they stop responding. Additionally, it serves as a parser of blockchain data to the bots running on top of it.
